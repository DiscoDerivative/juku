Introduction
Introduction to Testing
Ensure the software produces the correct result and efficiency.
Consider if the software works with edge cases, fails under high loads, knows how to handle incorrect data, and integrates with the rest of the system properly.
Make sure there is version control to restore to a backup in case an error happens.
Debugging
Debugging process includes locating the source of the bug, determining how to fix the bug, and implementing the solution.
Locating the bug takes a long time and needs print statements or debugging tools to find it.
What Does Testing Prove
Testing proves that the tests being run work correctly. 
Testing does not prove software is correct.
Time debugging is proportional to the bugs being found.
Almost all software has bugs in it.
Testing Vs Debugging
Testing and debugging are not the same.
Testing is when you run software and determine the result is what you expect it to be.
Debugging is the process of trying to locate and fix a problem in code you know has a bug.
In a company, the QA team runs tests and sends a bug report to the PM or team lead. The PM or team lead will tell a developer to debug the program.

Application: Why do we test software? What does testing prove? What is the difference between testing and debugging?
Niche: Who does the testing in a large company? Who does the debugging in a large company? What considerations are needed in testing? Why is version control needed in testing?
